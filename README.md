About Kilometrics

Kilometrics is a free online tool designed to help anyone quickly calculate the mass of steel and other materials. Whether you're an engineer, fabricator, architect, student, or DIY builder, Kilometrics makes it easy to estimate the weight of metal sections for design, costing, or transport planning.

Our calculator uses typical density values to help you find the mass of bars, beams, plates, sheets, and other common profiles. Simply select the material and shape, enter your dimensions, and see the result instantly in kilograms, tonnes, and pounds. You can also browse tables of standard steel sections to find typical weights and sizes used in industry.

Tip: To estimate the mass of anything, use the formula:

Mass = Volume × Density
Measure the dimensions accurately, convert them to consistent units, and multiply by the material’s density. Our tool does the math for you—saving time and helping you avoid costly mistakes.

Kilometrics is designed to be easy to use, accurate, and accessible on any device. We hope it helps you work faster, plan better, and get your projects done with confidence.
